            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-6">Introduction</h2>
            <p>The <Link to="/clinic-types/medical-spas" className="text-primary-dark hover:text-primary underline">medical spa</Link> industry in Texas has experienced remarkable growth over the past decade, with new facilities opening across <Link to="/locations/texas/houston" className="text-primary-dark hover:text-primary underline">Houston</Link>, <Link to="/locations/texas/dallas" className="text-primary-dark hover:text-primary underline">Dallas</Link>, <Link to="/locations/texas/austin" className="text-primary-dark hover:text-primary underline">Austin</Link>, and other metropolitan areas. This expansion reflects the increasing consumer demand for minimally invasive aesthetic procedures, wellness treatments, and anti-aging services. However, unlike traditional day spas, medspas operate in a complex regulatory environment that bridges both healthcare and cosmetic industries. The cornerstone of a legally compliant and successful medspa in Texas is establishing a proper relationship with a qualified <Link to="/services/medical-director" className="text-primary-dark hover:text-primary underline">medical director</Link> who provides the necessary <Link to="/services/medical-oversight" className="text-primary-dark hover:text-primary underline">medical oversight</Link> and <Link to="/services/medical-supervision" className="text-primary-dark hover:text-primary underline">supervision</Link>.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-6">Understanding the Medspa Landscape in Texas</h2>
            <p>Texas maintains specific regulations governing medspas, primarily through the Texas Medical Board and the Texas Department of State Health Services. These regulations are designed to ensure patient safety, proper medical oversight, and appropriate standards of care. Whether you're operating an <Link to="/clinic-types/aesthetic-clinics" className="text-primary-dark hover:text-primary underline">aesthetic clinic</Link>, <Link to="/clinic-types/weight-loss-clinics" className="text-primary-dark hover:text-primary underline">weight loss center</Link>, or <Link to="/clinic-types/wellness-centers" className="text-primary-dark hover:text-primary underline">wellness center</Link>, understanding these requirements is not just about legal compliance—it's about creating a foundation for a reputable business that delivers safe, effective treatments to clients.</p>
            
            <p>The Texas Medical Practice Act clearly establishes that many popular medspa treatments—including Botox injections, dermal fillers, laser treatments, and certain chemical peels—constitute the practice of medicine. This classification means these procedures must be performed either by a licensed physician or under appropriate physician supervision.</p>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">The Critical Role of a Medical Director in Texas Medspas</h3>
            <p>In the Texas medspa ecosystem, a medical director serves as more than just a name on legal documents. They function as the clinical authority responsible for establishing treatment protocols, ensuring proper patient selection, managing adverse events, and maintaining quality standards throughout the practice.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-6">Texas Medspa Legal Requirements and Regulatory Framework</h2>
            <p>Texas maintains specific laws governing medspas through the Texas Medical Board (TMB) and Texas Department of State Health Services. Unlike some states with dedicated "medspa laws," Texas regulates these facilities primarily through its broader medical practice regulations, corporate practice of medicine doctrine, and scope of practice limitations.</p>

            <p>The process of identifying qualified medical directors for your Texas medspa requires a strategic approach that goes beyond simply finding a physician willing to sign paperwork. Whether you're a <Link to="/services/medical-director/np" className="text-primary-dark hover:text-primary underline">nurse practitioner</Link>, <Link to="/services/medical-director/pa" className="text-primary-dark hover:text-primary underline">physician assistant</Link>, <Link to="/services/medical-director/rn" className="text-primary-dark hover:text-primary underline">registered nurse</Link>, or <Link to="/services/medical-director/layperson" className="text-primary-dark hover:text-primary underline">non-medical professional</Link>, the right medical director will significantly impact your medspa's clinical quality, regulatory compliance, and ultimately, its reputation and success.</p>
